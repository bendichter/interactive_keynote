Are animations supported?

The foreign object needs to have a body tag inside so that clean_fo adds the xmlns declaration. This gets inserted into the .svgp.

The script that is inserted into KeynoteDHTMLPlayer.html doesn't contain the script generated by bokeh components. It just has references to bokeh.js and bokeh.css. 

Then go into element to find the body within the foreign object within the svg. The css property `overflow` needs to have `hidden` unchecked. Also uncheck all of the `pointer-events: none`
Et voila.
